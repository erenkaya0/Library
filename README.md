ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

âœ… JavaScript Constructors & Prototypes â†’ I used a Book constructor function to create objects and added a toggleRead() method using prototypes.
âœ… DOM Manipulation â†’ I dynamically created and updated book elements using JavaScript (document.createElement, innerHTML).
âœ… Event Handling â†’ Handled form submission, button clicks, and dynamically generated buttons.
âœ… CSS Layout & Flexbox â†’ Designed a responsive book card layout that adjusts when resized.
âœ… Popup Form Handling â†’ Used JavaScript to show/hide the form smoothly.
âœ… Preventing Default Form Behavior â†’ Used event.preventDefault() to stop form submission from reloading the page.
